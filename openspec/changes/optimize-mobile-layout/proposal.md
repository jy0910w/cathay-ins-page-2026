# Change: Optimize Mobile Layout for 2026 Campaign

## Why
The desktop version is finalized, but the mobile version needs adjustment to provide the best user experience while keeping the desktop version unchanged.

## What Changes
- Adjust CSS for screens smaller than 768px (mobile).
- Refine padding, margins, font sizes, and element positioning for mobile.
- Ensure no impact on desktop styles (using max-width media queries or overriding only for mobile).

## Impact
- Affected specs: `campaign-site`
- Affected code: `new-campaign-2026/css/campaign-2026.css`
